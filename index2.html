                About Me
            </h1>
            <p>
                Welcome to my page! I am a coding enthusiast with an interest in cyber security and HR systems. 
            <p>
                I have worked for Rio Tinto since 2011 across a variety of roles. Starting out in HR systems and HR generalist advisory, I have worked in Brisbane and on site at our New Zealand and Gladstone Aluminium Smelters.
                Seeking to move back into a systems capacity, I accepted a Graduate IT role in 2018 where I dabbled in functional SAP configuration, supported an LMS project implementation and participated in a SoX audit. I continued my IT journey with roles in Portfolio Management & Governance and Transformation, whilst also completing a Post Graduate Certificate in IT.
            </p>
            </p>
                On a personal note, I live with my fiancé, young son and two cats. I am a creative soul who loves creature comforts, good food and wine and volunteering in my local community.
